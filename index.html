    <h1 style="text-align:center">Mind</h1>

    <p style="text-align:justify">This is a project page where I muse about what I think about psychology and anything 
       to do with the mind.</p>

    <p>It's surprising how you may be forced into an interlude of compulsive thinking on random mornings.You are sitting there enjoying a good hot cup of
       your favourite drink with an empty mind. Probably,the only things on your mind are the fragments of memories from the day earlier, good or bad, and complaints
       or excitement for the day ahead. Buzz.. your phone chirps cheerfully. A phone is the only thing that can be so cheerful and consistent all the time, well,
       atleast till the time it recieves so many messages at a strech that it can hardly decide how to buzz several times the same moment. So it emits a dragged out,
       broken record sound ending it with the usual cheeriness, much like a angry sweet girl who ends a harsh diatribe of something by an 'It's Okay' so sweet you 
       melt. Not that a girl and phone are similar. Give me an angry outburst over a barrage of phone messages anytime. Logic demands of the phone to sound one buzz 
       for every message, irrationality demands the girl to incinerate a situation with every ounce of intensity she has. I wonder who's successful. Messages on 
       phone are something that bind you to a darb social contract. A girl's "creative self-expression" is a completely different matter. Silence, 
       on the phone is an unacceptable breach of contract,silence in a girl's diatribe is an gesture of great understanding and patient listening. It's something that 
       frees you from necessarily using all of your faculties and senses in a conversation. When a girl is angry and talking, it is an ideal time for contemplation 
       of the deepest thoughts. Its a state of heightened consciousness where you can wander everywhere without losing track of what the girl is talking about. For
       you, it is meditation, for her it is therapy.  </p>
